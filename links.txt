Meta-Transformer is a unified multimodal learning framework that employs a shared encoder to extract representation across different modalities, reducing them to token sequences. These sequences, derived from 12 different modalities including text, image, audio, video, infrared, hyper-spectral, X-Ray, tabular, graph, time-series, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, can then be used to handle various tasks such as classification, detection and segmentation.

The paper titled "Tool Documentation Enables Zero-Shot Tool-Usage with Large Language Models" by Cheng-Yu Hsieh and seven other authors explores the potential of using tool documentation instead of demonstrations for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use new tools. The study argues that tool documentation is significantly more valuable than demonstrations as it achieves comparable performance and further expands the potential uses of LLMs, enabling new applications automatically.
